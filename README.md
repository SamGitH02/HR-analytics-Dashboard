# HR-analytics-Dashboard

The goal of this personal project was to empower myself with a tool that could enhance HR processes, talent management strategies, and employee engagement insights. By putting my expertise and creativity to work, I developed a comprehensive dashboard tailored to my specific needs and interests.
The endeavor was to explore the potential of data in HR and create a visual platform to make informed decisions. Armed with a wealth of employee data,, I embarked on this journey to uncover hidden patterns, identify opportunities, and shape a more engaging work environment.
